# Winter-23-Intern-IffcoTokio-AI-ML
<br>
Housing.csv was used on Day 2 and Day 3. This data was provided to me by one of my respected mentors, Geshu sir.
<br>
The data seems similar to the data from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/housing-price-prediction-linear-regression">link.</a>
<br>
Throughout this internship, I'm making notes and collecting important links and topics, and I aim to use all that + the knowledge I gain while working on the project to create a comprehensive 'Project Report'.
<br>
<h3>My methodology</h3>
I approached this valuable opportunity in this manner:<br><br>
- Guidance from my mentors: Arpit sir, Geshu sir and Sumit sir<br>
- Learning concepts from YouTube, Coursera, GeeksForGeeks and Kaggle Notebooks<br>
- Making notes in my journal, text files and Jupyter Notebooks (all of which can be found here in .pdf, .ipynb and .txt files in this repository)
