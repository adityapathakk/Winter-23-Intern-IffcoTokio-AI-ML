# Winter-23-Intern-IffcoTokio-AI-ML

Housing.csv was used on Day 2 and Day 3. This data was provided to me by one of my respected mentors, Mr. Geshu Sinha.
<br>
The data seems similar to the data from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/ashydv/housing-price-prediction-linear-regression">link.</a>

Throughout this internship, I'm making notes and collecting important links and topics, and I aim to use all that + the knowledge I gain while working on the project to create a comprehensive 'Project Report'.
