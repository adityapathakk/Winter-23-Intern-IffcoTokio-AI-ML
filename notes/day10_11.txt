will push day 10 and day 11 work together.
today, i continued with data cleaning. the first stage is almost finished, i.e. individual files have been cleaned and merged.
now all these merged files (coverage, vehicle, header, contact) need to be joined on the primary key (p400 policy#), and then some more data cleaning may be required.
also, data is going to be imbalanced, so we need to see how we deal with that (under/over sampling or something else).
after that, we'll probably move to data visualisation, exploration, EDA.

head_cov_contact_veh files have been merged. primary key duplicates removed. target column (bothLOB) created.
need to deal with data imbalance and find out relationships with target column by conducting data exploration.
